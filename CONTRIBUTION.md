# How to Contribute

I'm happy to accept contributions to the main project. Please have a look into the Issues (especially those that are tagged as "help wanted") and see if you can submit a pull request that implements one of it. I'm happy to discuss details with you before you start to work. Maybe we can collaborate on a new feature.

You can also submit pull requests for fixes and features that are not alrady in the issues. If I like it, I will merge it ;-)
